# Weather-Forecasting-with-Neural-Prophet-and-Python
This project demonstrates how to use the NeuralProphet library, a powerful time series forecasting tool, to predict weather patterns. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and visualization of the forecasted weather data.Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare historical weather data for model training.
Model Training: Utilize NeuralProphet, built on top of Facebook Prophet and PyTorch, to train a weather forecasting model.
Forecast Visualization: Generate and visualize weather forecasts using Plotly for interactive plots.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-forecasting-neuralprophet.git
cd weather-forecasting-neuralprophet
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Install additional dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install plotly-resampler ipywidgets>=7.0.0
Usage
Prepare your data: Ensure your weather data is in a suitable format (e.g., CSV) and includes the necessary fields such as date and temperature.

Run the script: Execute the main script to preprocess the data, train the model, and visualize the forecast.

bash
Copy code
python weather_forecast.py
